# Undergraduate-Research
My codes are for undergraduate  research 

// These codes are for an Ardunio basded application using a variety of sensors and circuits such as 
// RGB, Ultrasonic, Object, Line, and much more. 

//These codes use a varity of libraries used to determine and calcualte various forms of data such as: 
// Distance, Light, Motion, Objects, Reflectivitiy. 

// These codes are split in individual circuits are combination of circuits. 
// Named accordignly to what they do and what sensors they use each code is for the unique or combination of sensors
// This will allow sensors to reocord seperate data and compile that data to be used to produce a sinlge output.

// The application of thses sensors are for an autonomous self diriving car project.
// These codes were to be uploaded to the arduinos attached to circuit on the vehicle (Power wheels)
// That wiuld then allow the vehicle to move dependent upon various forms of data inputed.
